# icarus
This project consists of designing, building and testing a mobile robot. The system is a self-contained robot able to negotiate a maze in the shortest possible time. In the micromouse project rules, the maze is composed by 16x16 squares; the goal (2x2 square) is placed in the centre of the maze. Starting from a corner of the maze, the micromouse needs to complete the maze without any external help. For completing the maze, firstly, the micromouse needs to find the centre. After that, the robot needs to return to the start position and then execute the fast route to the centre. The work involves a huge number of skills that is included in a mobile robot, such as working with embedded programming, designing and building PCB boards, dealing with sensor components and solving mechanical issues.
